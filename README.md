by Abhilash, Eric, and Vibhor   

Gesture Based Caregiving is a system that allows bedridden and injured patients to easily submit care requests with gesture-based controls using a Leap Motion controller. When requests are submitted, they are queued in a web-based visual management system - caregivers can visually verify and mark off completed tasks. We also include text and email notifications when high-priority requests are submitted.
